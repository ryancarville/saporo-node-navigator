This is a coding challenge created by the [Saporo](https://www.saporo.io) Frontend team to enable them to asses the interviewee's coding practices and style.  This coding challenge is designed to give you an idea of the daily work youâ€™ll be doing with [Saporo](https://www.saporo.io), and to give you an opportunity to demonstrate how you think about implementing features and how you think about components in the UI.

### Tech Stack
- Svelte (Framework)
- TypeScript (Language)
- JavaScript (Language)
- HTML5 (Language)
- CSS5 (Language)

## Overview

This app is a Node Navigator where a list of nodes is rendered and can be expanded to learn more about a node and display all the other nodes that are directly connected to it.  It assumes the nodes received are a collection of objects and in this challenge it uses dummy data which can be found in the directory `src/data`.

## Live Demo
[Live Demo Site](https://saporo-node-navigator.vercel.app/)
## Get started (from initial repo clone)

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd saporo-node-navigator
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the app running.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimized version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
